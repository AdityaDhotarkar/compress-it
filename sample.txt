Preface 
Since the Soviet Union shocked the western world by launching the first artificial 
satellite, SPUTNIK I, on October 4, 1957, the science of satellites and satellite 
communications has undergone an amazing evolution. Today satellites play an 
essential role in global communications including telephony, data networking, 
video transporting and distribution, as well as television and radio broadcasting 
directly to the consumer. They fulfill critical missions for governments, the military 
and other organizations that require reliable communications links throughout the 
world, and generate billions of dollars annually in revenue for private enterprise. 
Communications satellites offer several important advantages over other types of 
long-range communications systems: the capability of direct communication 
between two points on earth with only one intermediate relay (the satellite), the 
ability to broadcast or collect signals and data to or from any area ranging up to 
the entire surface of the world, and the ability to provide services to remote 
regions where ground-based, point-to-point communications would be impractical 
or impossible. 
One of the greatest advantages of satellite communications systems is the ratio 
of capacity versus cost. Although satellites are expensive to develop, launch and 
maintain, their tremendous capacity makes them very attractive for many 
applications. INTELSAT I, launched in 1965, had a capacity of only 240 two-way 
telephone channels or one two-way television channel, and an annual cost of 
$32 500 per channel. Since then, the capacity and lifetime of communication 
satellites have increased tremendously resulting in a drastic reduction in the cost 
per channel. Communications satellites now have capacities sufficient for several 
hundred video channels or tens of thousands of voice or data links. 
In addition to applications designed specifically for communications purposes, 
satellites are used extensively for navigation systems, scientific research, 
mapping, remote sensing, military reconnaissance, disaster detection and relief 
and for many other applications. All of these applications, however, require at 
least one communications link between the satellite and one or more earth 
stations. 
The Satellite Communications Training System is a state-of-the-art training 
system for the field of satellite communications. Specifically designed for handson training, the system covers modern satellite communication technologies 
including analog and digital modulation. It is designed to use realistic satellite 
uplink and downlink frequencies at safe power levels and to reflect the standards 
commonly used in modern satellite communications systems. 
The Orbit Simulator provides interactive visualization of satellite orbital 
mechanics and coverage, and the theory behind antenna alignment with 
geostationary satellites. The optional Dish Antenna and Accessories provides 
hands-on experience in aligning a typical antenna with real geostationary 
satellites. Preface

Safety considerations 
Safety symbols that may be used in this manual and on the equipment are listed 
in the Safety Symbols table at the beginning of the manual. 
Safety procedures related to the tasks that you will be asked to perform are 
indicated in each exercise. 
Make sure that you are wearing appropriate protective equipment when 
performing the tasks. You should never perform a task if you have any reason to 
think that a manipulation could be dangerous for you or your teammates. 
When studying communications systems, it is very important to develop good 
safety habits. Although microwaves are invisible, they can be dangerous at high About This Manual

levels or for long exposure times. The most important safety rule when working 
with microwave equipment is to avoid exposure to dangerous radiation levels. 
The radiation levels in the Satellite Communications Training System are too low 
to be dangerous. The highest power level in the system is at the RF OUTPUT of 
the Earth Station Transmitter and is typically 5 dBm (approximately 3.2 mW) at 
11 GHz. The maximum power density that can be produced by the Satellite 
Communications Training System using the supplied equipment is approximately 
0.13 mW/cm2, well below all Canadian, American and European standards for 
both microwave exposed workers and the general public.

When you have completed this exercise, you will be familiar with the basic 
concepts of satellite communications systems, including the different segments 
of a satellite communications system, the main types of services provided and 
the frequency bands used. In addition, you will be familiar with the Satellite 
Communications Training System. 
The Discussion of this exercise covers the following points: 
 Segmentation of a satellite communications system
 Satellite communications services and frequency bands
 Quality of Service (QoS)
 The Satellite Communications Training System
 The Telemetry and Instrumentation Add-On
 Signal levels
 Safety with RF fields
Segmentation of a satellite communications system 
A satellite communications system is a complex system that consists of many 
different elements. The system requires the constant attention of many skilled 
people in order to remain operational. 
A typical system can be divided into three distinct segments (see Figure 1-11). 
 The ground segment (GS) consists of the earth stations and other groundbased facilities used for communications traffic. With some systems, such as 
with the global positioning system (GPS), broadcasting satellite service 
(BSS) systems — also called direct broadcasting service (DBS), very small 
aperture terminal (VSAT) networks, and some military satellites, earth 
stations consist entirely of user terminals that interface directly with the space 
segment. In this case, the ground segment may be called the user segment 
(US). 
 The space segment (SS) consists of one or more satellites in space, 
including both active and spare satellites. A group of active satellites is said 
to form a constellation. The launch vehicle and all of the facilities required to 
launch satellites and place them in orbit are also considered part of the 
space segment. 
 The control segment (CS) includes all of the ground equipment and 
facilities that are required for operation, control, monitoring and management 
of the space segment and, in many systems, management of the terrestrial 
network.

Information is transmitted over free-space links. A one-way link from the ground 
to the satellite is called an uplink. A link from the satellite to the ground is a 
downlink.

Ground segment 
The ground segment consists of all of the traffic earth stations in the system. 
These earth stations may be of several types, and the ‘size’ of the stations (that 
is, the diameter of the antenna) may range from very small (a few centimeters) to

very large (tens of meters), depending on the application and the types of 
services offered by the system. 
There are three basic types of earth stations, as shown in Figure 1-11. A satellite 
communications system may include a combination of these types: 
 User stations are user terminals that interface directly with the space 
segment. These include very small aperture terminals (VSATs) with 
antenna sizes ranging below 3 m, ultra small aperture terminals (USATs)
with antenna sizes under 0.5 m, mobile units and handsets as well as 
receiving terminals for Broadcasting Satellite Service (BSS), also known as 
Direct Broadcast Service (DBS) or Direct-to-Home (DTH). 
 Interface stations act as gateways between the space segment and a 
terrestrial network to which user terminals are attached. Today, these 
interface stations are typically from 2 to 10 m in size. Early INTELSAT earth 
stations in the mid ‘60s measured up to 30 m. 
 Service stations act as an interface between the space segment and a 
terrestrial service provider. A connection between a service provider and the 
users usually goes through a feeder station (for broadcasting services, etc.) 
or a hub (for collecting services). 
A one-way connection from a user terminal through all associated ground 
facilities, the ground segment, and the space segment, back to the ground 
segment and to another user terminal, is called a simplex connection. Two-way 
communication requires a duplex connection consisting of two simplex 
connections, one for each direction. 
In any communications system, the signal is the voltage or waveform that 
conveys information from one user terminal to another. The adjective baseband
is used to describe signals whose range of frequencies is measured from 
approximately 0 Hz to the highest frequency in the signal. The baseband signal
is therefore the signal that initially represents the information one wants to 
convey. The baseband signal can either be analog (taking on any value within a 
given range) or digital (taking on a finite number of discrete values). 
At the transmitting earth station, the baseband signal is used to modulate a 
sinusoidal carrier. The modulation technique used depends on the type of 
baseband signal being transmitted. To transmit an analog baseband signal, 
analog modulation, usually FM, is used. To transmit a digital baseband signal, 
digital modulation, usually a form of phase-shift keying (PSK), is used. 
The modulation process shifts the baseband signal up in frequency so that it is 
centered on the frequency of the carrier and filters it so that it occupies only the 
necessary frequency range. This range is called the intermediate 
frequency (IF). This signal is usually shifted to a higher frequency (up 
conversion) one or more times to the radio frequency (RF). With satellite 
communications, the RF band for a particular earth station is typically 
somewhere between 1 and 30 GHz. Using high frequencies reduces atmospheric 
attenuation and allows constructing high gain antennas of reasonable size. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion

The earth station antenna transmits the RF signal to the satellite repeater. The 
repeater retransmits the signal to one or several earth stations. At the receiving 
earth station, the received RF signal is shifted to a lower frequency (down 
conversion) in one or more stages to an IF frequency. The IF signal is then 
demodulated in order to recover the original baseband signal. 
Information is transmitted over the uplink and downlink using modulated carriers. 
In many cases, each carrier can carry several signals simultaneously by the use 
of time division multiplexing (TDM) or frequency division multiplexing (FDM). 
Each carrier, therefore, can be considered to provide a number of channels. The 
signals are multiplexed in the baseband into a single signal that modulates a 
carrier which is transmitted to the satellite and relayed to another earth station. 
This is referred to as multiple channels per carrier (MCPC) (sometimes called 
multiple connections per carrier). The modulated carrier usually occupies the 
entire bandwidth of one transponder. 
MCPC using FDM can be used to transmit multiplexed analog voice signals. 
MCPC using TDM is used to transmit multiplexed digital signals, such as digital 
television channels for direct broadcasting to subscribers. 
When there is no baseband multiplexing, each carrier provides only one channel. 
This arrangement is called single channel per carrier (SCPC) (sometimes 
called single connection per carrier). It is much simpler than MCPC and is 
frequently used to transmit analog television signals. It is typically used for feeds 
rather than for direct programming. With SCPC, a channel often provides a 
dedicated, permanent connection between two earth stations. 
Table 1-1 shows some of the advantages and disadvantages of SCPC and 
MCPC. 
Table 1-1. Comparison of SCPC and MCPC. 
SCPC MCPC 
Advantages 
 Uses simple and reliable technology and 
low-cost earth station equipment. 
 One connection can use any bandwidth up 
to the full bandwidth of a transponder. 
 Easy to uplink from multiple transmitting 
earth stations to the same transponder. 
 Easy to add additional receiving earth 
stations. 
 More efficient use of available bandwidth. 
Many multiplexed signals can be 
transmitted using one carrier that occupies 
the full bandwidth of a transponder. No 
guard bands are required. 
 Does not require a dedicated channel for 
each connection. 
 Ideal for burst transmissions such as 
packet data transmission. 
Disadvantages 
 Less efficient use of bandwidth. Guard 
bands must be used when a transponder is 
shared by multiple carriers in order to 
prevent mutual interference. 
 Inefficient for burst transmission. 
 Customer pays for a dedicated connection 
even when it is not being used, unless 
SCPC DAMA is implemented. 
 All signals are multiplexed at one location 
and demultiplexed at another location. This 
requires a network infrastructure. 
The overall downlink bandwidth of a satellite repeater 
is usually split into several 
sub-bands by a set of filters 
and each sub-band is amplified separately. One subband is referred to as a 
satellite channel and the 
equipment related to this 
sub-band is called a transponder, a combination of 
the words transmitter and 
responder. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion

With single channel per carrier (SCPC), the bandwidth of a modulated carrier 
may be less than the bandwidth of one transponder. In this case, other 
modulated carriers of somewhat different frequencies can pass through the same 
transponder, providing a guard band is left between each of the modulated 
signals so that their frequency ranges do not overlap. Using different carrier 
frequencies to give several signals simultaneous access to the same transponder 
is called frequency division multiple access. 
When a dedicated connection is not required, an SCPC connection can be 
established temporarily for communications between two earth stations and then 
terminated at the end of the communication. This arrangement, called SCPC 
demand assigned multiple access (SCPC DAMA), allows the carrier to be 
used by different parties one at a time. 
Another type of multiple access is called time division multiple access 
(TDMA). At each earth station, a TDMA terminal divides access to the satellite 
into regular time slots. During each time slot, a burst of data from a particular 
source is transmitted from one earth station to one of the satellite transponders. 
The transponder retransmits the burst to another earth station where a TDMA 
terminal routes the data to the correct destination. A buffer memory at each 
TDMA terminal allows continuous data transfer with the terrestrial network. 
Space segment 
There are many different types of satellites providing a wide variety of capabilities 
and services. All satellites, however, have two main subsystems: the payload 
and the platform. The payload consists of all the equipment on the satellites that 
carries out the mission of the satellite. On a communication satellite, the payload 
consists of all the components that provide communications services, that is, 
which receive, process, amplify and retransmit information. The payload can be 
divided into two parts: the antennas and the repeater. 
An antenna is a conductive structure designed to receive and transmit 
electromagnetic energy. The satellite antennas serve as interfaces between the 
uplink and downlink signals and the components inside the satellite. Antennas 
may be designed for different types of coverage, a term that designates the area 
on the earth where communication with the satellite is possible. With global 
coverage, communication is possible with roughly all points on earth that are 
visible from the satellite. With reduced coverage (zone coverage or spot 
coverage), the coverage is concentrated on a particular region of the visible earth 
in order to make efficient use of the available power (see Figure 1-12). Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion
18 © Festo Didactic 86311-10 
Figure 1-12. Global, zone, and spot coverage of a geostationary satellite. 
Spot coverage antennas may have fixed or steerable beams. Where the 
coverage must be contoured to cover an arbitrary region, such as a continent, 
multiple beam antennas can be used. 
Besides the antennas, the remaining components of the payload make up the 
repeater. There are two main types of repeater for a communications satellite: 
transparent and regenerative. A transparent repeater (or transparent payload) 
does not demodulate the uplink signal. Instead, it simply shifts the uplink signal to 
a different frequency (usually a lower frequency) and amplifies it for 
retransmission over the downlink. 
The elevation is the angle 
that an antenna must be 
raised above the horizon in 
order to point directly at the 
satellite. 
The term repeater originated with telegraphy and 
referred to an electromechanical device used to 
regenerate telegraph signals. Use of the term has 
continued in telephony, data 
communications and satellite communications.

Figure 1-13.	 Transparent payload or repeater. 
Figure 1-13 shows a simplified block diagram of a transparent repeater. The 
uplink signal from the antenna is amplified and then down-converted to the 
downlink frequency range in order to prevent the strong downlink signal from 
interfering with the weak uplink signal. The overall downlink bandwidth of a 
satellite repeater is usually split into several sub-bands by a set of filters and 
each sub-band is amplified separately. One sub-band is referred to as a satellite 
channel and the equipment related to this sub-band is called a transponder, a 
combination of the words transmitter and responder. Each transponder usually 
has sufficient bandwidth for a number of carriers at different frequencies or for 
one wideband multiplexed signal. (See Appendix F Satellite Transponders for an 
example of the frequencies, polarizations and channels of a typical satellite.) 
Filters and other components are used to reject out-of-band noise and 
interference and to improve performance. The power gain of each transponder is 
of the order of 100 to 130 dB and typically raises the power of the uplink signal 
from a few hundred picowatts to the downlink power of roughly ten to one 
hundred watts. When multi-beam antennas are used, the routing of signals from 
one up beam to a given down beam is done at the RF frequency. 
A regenerative repeater (or regenerative payload) demodulates the uplink 
signal to recover the baseband signals, carries out baseband signal processing 
and switching, and then remodulates the baseband signals with a carrier at the 
downlink frequency (different from the uplink frequency) before power 
amplification and retransmission (see Figure 1-14). Although this is more 
complex and costly than a transparent payload, it allows onboard processing and 
signal routing at the baseband.

Figure 1-14. Regenerative payload. 
Analog satellite communication systems are exclusively the regenerative type. 
Digital systems may use either type. 
The platform, often called the bus, consists of all the components that permit the 
payload to operate and remain operational over a long period of time. The 
platform provides the mechanical structure of the satellite, supplies electrical 
power to the payload, and has propulsion and control systems used to maintain 
the satellite in the desired orbit and attitude as well as a system to maintain 
thermal stability. The platform also has provision for two-way communication with 
the control segment. 
The most common type of electrical power system in a satellite consists of a 
combination of solar cells and rechargeable batteries. Solar irradiance varies 
over time due to variations in sun spot activity and other factors. On the average, 
its value is roughly 1370 W/m2 (130 W per square foot). Since solar cells have 
only limited efficiency (approximately 15% for conventional silicon solar cells), 
satellites requiring high power must have a large area of solar cells. Batteries are 
required because the satellite spends some time in a state of eclipse, that is, in 
the earth’s or the moon’s shadow. For a geostationary satellite, eclipses occur 
during two 45 day periods per year and can have a duration as long as 72 
minutes. Low earth orbit satellites can spend up to 50% of their time in eclipses 
of shorter duration (30 to 40 minutes). 
The attitude of a satellite is 
its orientation with respect 
to a given frame of reference. Attitude control can 
be done by making the 
satellite spin or by using an 
internal gyroscope and 
thrusters to stabilize it in 
three axes.

Control segment 
The control segment consists of ground facilities used for platform and payload 
monitoring and control as well as management of communications traffic and of 
the various communications resources of the satellites. Platform and payload 
monitoring and control are accomplished using tracking, telemetry and 
command (TTC or TT&C) (sometimes called tracking, telemetry and control). It 
may also be referred to as tracking, telemetry, command and monitoring 
(TTC&M). 
The TTC system performs the following functions: 
Tracking: Detecting the precise location of the satellite. 
Telemetry: Monitoring the status of the various components of the payload 
and of the platform, acquiring confirmation of commands, and 
transmitting this information to the control segment on the ground. 
Command: Receiving signals from the control segment on the ground in order 
to control onboard equipment and to initiate maneuvers. 
Satellite communications services and frequency bands 
Types of satellite services 
Although the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum covers a 
vast range of frequencies, only a portion of this range is suitable for satellite 
communications. Below approximately 100 MHz, the ionosphere causes a high 
degree of attenuation. In addition, the spectrum between 300 MHz and 1 GHz is 
exceedingly crowded with terrestrial applications, which could result in 
interference between different applications. 
The choice of the frequency band for satellite communications involves a tradeoff between several constraints. In general, the lower the frequency band, the 
better the propagation characteristics, but the higher the frequency band, the 
greater the available bandwidth. For some applications, such as Mobile Satellite 
Services (MSS), the propagation characteristics are crucial and the bandwidth 
required by each service is relatively small, so lower frequency bands are 
generally used. Other applications, such as direct-to-home (DTH) broadcasting 
and broadband data services, are only practical in higher frequency bands 
because of the large bandwidth required. With these higher frequency bands, 
antennas are more directional. Directional antennas offer the added benefit of 
using spatial separation to avoid interference between links using the same 
frequency. 
Frequency bands are referred to using adjectives or letter designations. 
Table 1-2 shows adjectival designations for frequency bands used in satellite 
communications. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion

The usage of radio frequencies for different services is regulated by the 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations organization. The 
ITU publishes Radio Regulations (RR) which refer to the following types of 
satellite services: 
 Fixed Satellite Service (FSS): A satellite service that uses fixed 
terrestrial terminals. In other words, FSS is any satellite service where 
the ground station does not change locations frequently. Examples are: 
 Point-to-point communications 
 Corporate networks 
 Very small aperture terminal (VSAT) terminals 
 Transportable terminals that remain fixed during use, such as 
satellite newsgathering (SNG) terminals 
 Mobile Satellite Service (MSS): A satellite service that uses portable 
terrestrial terminals, mainly for telephone communications. MSS 
terminals may be mounted on a ship, an airplane, or a vehicle, or, as 
with portable satellite telephones, may even be carried by a person. The 
major supplier of MSS services is INMARSAT. MSS services are divided 
into three main categories: 
 Maritime Mobile Satellite Service (MMSS) 
 Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service (AMSS) 
 Land Mobile Satellite Service (LMSS) 
 Broadcasting Satellite Service (BSS): A type of Fixed Satellite Service 
used to provide audio and video entertainment directly to consumers. 
The terms Direct Broadcast Satellite or Direct Broadcast Service (DBS), 
or Direct-to-Home (DTH) are also used. 
 BSS-TV is designed to provide conventional television signals 
directly to the consumer. 
 BSS-HDTV is designed to provide high-definition television signals 
directly to the consumer. 
 BSS-Sound is designed to provide high quality audio signals to fixed 
and mobile consumer terminals. The term satellite digital audio radio 
service (SDARS) is also used. 
 Other services: 
 Space Operation Service (SOS): A radio communication service 
concerned exclusively with the operation of spacecraft, in particular 
tracking, telemetry and command. 
 Amateur Satellite Service (ASS) or Amsat 
 Earth Exploration Satellite Service (ESSS) 
 Radio Determination Satellite Service (RSSS) 
 Radio Navigation Satellite Service (RNSS) 
 Space Research Service (SRS) 
 Intersatellite Service (ISS) Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion

The Radio Regulations specify detailed radio spectrum allotments for the 
different services. These regulations are voluminous and very detailed. Table 1-4 
provides a brief summary. Frequency bands are identified in this table using 
letter or adjectival designations. Some bands are also referred to using 
approximate uplink and downlink frequencies. For example, the “6/4 band” is 
another name for the C-band. The names “13/11 band”, “13-14/11-12 band” and 
“18/12 band” all refer to different segments of the Ku band.

Most satellite communications systems operate in the C, X, Ku or Ka bands of 
the microwave spectrum. These frequencies allow large bandwidth while 
avoiding the crowded UHF frequencies and staying below the atmospheric 
absorption of EHF frequencies. Satellite TV either operates in the C band for the Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion

traditional large dish fixed satellite service or Ku band for direct-broadcast 
satellite. Military communications run primarily over X or Ku-band links, with Ka 
band being increasingly used for VSAT communications and for Milstar (the 
Military Strategic and Tactical Relay) system of the United States Air Force. 
Quality of Service (QoS) 
Ideally, the recovered baseband signal would be a perfect copy of the original 
baseband signal and with no delay. In addition, communication would be 
perfectly reliable with no interruption. In a practical communications system, 
however, these ideals are never met. The recovered baseband signal contains 
noise (analog signal) or bit errors (digital signal). There is a non-negligible delay 
between the recovered signal and the original. Also, there may be periods when 
transmission is not possible, that is, when the communications channel is not 
available. The term quality of service (QoS) refers to quantitative 
measurements of the performance, delay and availability provided by the system. 
Required QoS levels are often specified in a service level agreement (SLA), a 
contract between a service provider and its customer that defines the minimum 
QoS needed for customer application performance. 
For an analog baseband signal, performance is measured in terms of the signal 
to noise ratio (S/N). For a digital baseband signal, it is measured in terms of bit 
error ratio or bit error rate (BER). Delay is measured in milliseconds, and 
availability is the fraction of time during which the communications service is 
provided with the desired performance. 
c Factors that affect the quality of service in a satellite communications system 
are covered in detail in the manual Link Characteristics and Performance. 
The Satellite Communications Training System 
The Satellite Communications Training System is a state-of-the-art training 
system for the field of satellite communications. Specifically designed for handson training, the system covers modern satellite communication technologies 
including analog and digital modulation. It is designed to use realistic satellite 
uplink and downlink frequencies at safe power levels and to reflect the standards 
commonly used in modern satellite communications systems. 
The Satellite Communications Training System includes three RF modules: the 
Earth Station Transmitter, the Earth Station Receiver, and the Satellite Repeater. 
The Earth Station Transmitter and the Earth Station Receiver are designed to 
teach both wideband analog and high-speed digital baseband processing and 
modulation/demodulation techniques as well as frequency conversion between 
the intermediate and RF frequencies. The Satellite Repeater is designed to teach 
the operation of a transparent repeater. 
Two other modules, the Data Generation/Acquisition Interface and the Virtual 
Instrument, are part of the optional Telemetry and Instrumentation Add-On. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion

The Earth Station Transmitter 
Figure 1-15. The Earth Station Transmitter. 
The Earth Station Transmitter, Model 9570, includes an Analog Modulator and a 
Digital Modulator as well as two up converters. 
The Analog Modulator provides pre-emphasis baseband processing as well as 
wideband FM modulation. The Wideband FM Modulator generates a modulated 
signal at the first intermediate frequency (IF 1) of the transmitter. 
The 10 MHz bandwidth of the Wideband FM Modulator is sufficient for 
transmitting one composite television signal, an example of single channel per 
carrier (SCPC) transmission, or a number of multiplexed telephone connections 
using frequency division multiplexing (FDM)1, an example of multiple connections 
per carrier (MCPC). 
The Digital Modulator provides baseband processing and DQPSK (differential 
QPSK) modulation. The baseband section includes a 4-input TDM multiplexer, 
allowing for the time division multiplexing of up to four data streams at a 
maximum bit rate of 4 Mb/s each.2 A fifth input is provided for the transmission of 
one unmultiplexed data stream of up to 20 Mb/s. 
 
1 User-supplied equipment is required to multiplex and demultiplex the analog signals. 
2 The bit rate of DATA INPUT 4 is limited by the capacity of the serial USB port. 
The bit rate Rୠ of a digital 
signal is the number of bits 
sent per second. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion

A Scrambler is used to ensure frequent transitions in the data and to spread the 
power smoothly over the available bandwidth. A Clock & Frame Encoder is used 
with TDM to add transitions to the multiplexed data in order to ensure reliable 
clock recovery in the receiver as well as control bits for frame synchronization. 
The digital data is applied to a DQPSK Modulator which generates a digitally 
modulated signal at the first intermediate frequency (IF 1) of the transmitter. 
This intermediate frequency from either the Analog Modulator or the Digital 
Modulator is up converted in two stages by Up Converter 1 and Up Converter 2 
in order to produce the RF Output signal. Up Converter 2 includes a Channel 
selector to select one of six carrier frequencies in the 11 GHz range. The 
antenna connected to the RF output transmits the uplink RF signal to the Satellite 
Repeater. 
Up Converter 2 also has a Power Sensor (see Power Sensors). 
The Earth Station Receiver 
Figure 1-16. The Earth Station Receiver. 
Earth Station Receiver, Model 9571, has an RF INPUT to which the receiving 
antenna is connected. The received downlink signal is down-converted in two 
stages. Down Converter 2 includes a Channel selector to select one of six carrier 
frequencies in the 9 GHz range. Down Converter 1 has a variable Gain control. 
Digital satellite communications usually use a form of 
PSK (phase shift keying) 
modulation, such as QPSK 
(quadrature phase-shift 
keying). DQPSK is QPSK 
with differential encoding. 
These topics are covered in 
Unit 3. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion
28 © Festo Didactic 86311-10 
The output signal of Down Converter 1 is at the first intermediate frequency (IF 1) 
of the receiver. 
Down Converter 1 and 2 each have a Power Sensor (see Power Sensors). 
The Earth Station Receiver includes both an Analog Demodulator and a Digital 
Demodulator, both operating at IF 1. The Analog Demodulator provides 
wideband FM demodulation as well as baseband de-emphasis processing. The 
Digital Demodulator provides DQPSK demodulation as well as baseband 
processing and TDM demultiplexing of the demodulated data. 
The differential QPSK digital modulation used in the Earth Station Transmitter
produces a suppressed-carrier modulated signal. However, the demodulator in 
the Earth Station Receiver requires a copy of the transmitted carrier in order to 
demodulated the signal and recover the data. The QPSK Costas Loop in the 
Digital Demodulator of the receiver is a circuit that reconstructs the missing 
carrier and then decodes the data. 
A Costas loop is a type of phased-locked loop often used to recover a carrier 
from a suppressed-carrier modulation signal, such as a QPSK. It includes an 
oscillator whose frequency and phase are controlled using a feedback loop. The 
feedback loop causes the oscillator to lock onto one of the phases present in the 
QPSK signal. Once the Costas loop is locked, it tracks that phase in order to 
keep the recovered carrier at the correct frequency and phase. The recovered 
carrier is a stable, sinusoidal waveform that is equivalent to the carrier signal 
used in the transmitter modulator. This recovered carrier is used to demodulate 
the digitally modulated signal. 
The QPSK Costas Loop in the Earth Station Receiver recovers the carrier and 
demodulates the QPSK signal in order to recover the raw data that represents 
the differentially encoded symbols. This Costas loop is locked manually. The 
steps required to lock the Costas loop are given in the exercise Procedure. 
The Satellite Repeater 
Figure 1-17. The Satellite Repeater. 
The Satellite Repeater, Model 9572, uses separate uplink and downlink 
antennas. It contains a wideband receiver consisting of a low-noise 
amplifier (LNA), a down converter to shift the 11 GHz uplink signal down to the 
9 GHz downlink range and an amplifier. This is followed by a telemetry-controlled Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion

variable gain amplifier (VGA), an isolator, a band-pass filter, and a power 
amplifier (PA). 
Several components of the Satellite Repeater are redundant, that is, there is a 
main and a backup unit. These are controlled by telemetry and are used in 
troubleshooting exercises. LEDs on the front panel show which unit is currently in 
use. 
The Satellite Repeater also has a Power Sensor (see Power Sensors). 
Power Sensors 
To facilitate antenna alignment and measurement of RF power levels, the Earth 
Station Transmitter, the Earth Station Receiver, and the Satellite Repeater each 
have a Power Sensor. The Power Sensor converts the detected power level into 
a dc voltage. This voltage is available at the POWER SENSOR OUTPUT and/or 
is used to drive Level LEDs. 
Users of conventional instruments can observe a relative indication of the power 
by connecting a dc voltmeter to the POWER SENSOR OUTPUT. If necessary, 
the measured voltage can be converted into an absolute power level in dBm by 
referring to Appendix E Using Conventional Instruments. 
Users of the optional Telemetry and Instrumentation Add-On can read the power 
level directly in dBm using the virtual True RMS Voltmeter / Power Meter. For 
this, the POWER SENSOR OUTPUT is connected to one input of the Virtual 
Instrument, and the appropriate module is selected as the Source of the 
True RMS Voltmeter / Power Meter. 
In addition to direct measurement, the power of the Satellite Repeater can also 
be measured remotely from the earth station, using telemetry. In this case, the 
power is displayed in dBm in the Telemetry tab of the Telemetry and 
Instrumentation application. 
a The Power Sensors and the spectrum analyzer indicate power differently. A 
spectrum analyzer shows the power of each individual frequency component 
present in the signal whereas the Power Sensor produces a dc voltage 
proportional to the sum of the powers of all frequency components in its range. 
Since the spectrum analyzer displays only a limited range of frequencies at a 
time, some significant frequency components, including parasitic frequency 
components, may not be visible on the spectrum analyzer display. They will, 
however, be included in the Power Sensor reading. For this reason, and 
because of non-linearities in the two instruments, they may not indicate exactly 
the same power. 
In addition, the Power Sensors are calibrated for the Channel D frequencies. 
When using other channels, the Power Sensors may give less accurate 
results. 
For measuring the power of a single frequency component (e.g. the power of 
an unmodulated carrier signal), the spectrum analyzer will give more accurate 
results – the Power Sensor generally indicates a higher power than the 
spectrum analyzer does. For measuring the total power of a complex signal, 
however, the Power Sensor is much easier to use. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion

On the Satellite Repeater, the three Power Sensor Level LEDs provide a rough 
indication of the power at the RF OUTPUT, which is proportional to the power at 
the RF INPUT. The greater the power, the more LEDs are lit. 
On the Earth Station Receiver, the three Power Sensor Level LEDs provide a 
rough indication of the power at the IF OUTPUT of Down Converter 1, which is 
proportional to the power at the RF INPUT and to the Gain adjustment. During 
normal operation, the Gain should be adjusted so the green LED is lit. The red 
‒ LED and  LED indicate that the power level is too low or too high, 
respectively. 
The Telemetry and Instrumentation Add-On 
The optional Telemetry and Instrumentation Add-On, Model 8093-1, provides an 
alternative to costly conventional instruments. This add-on, used in conjunction 
with the Telemetry and Instrumentation application, provides telemetry with the 
Satellite Receiver as well as a full suite of virtual instruments. 
The Telemetry and Instrumentation Add-On consists of two modules: 
Figure 1-18. The Data Generation/Acquisition Interface. 
The Data Generation/Acquisition Interface, Model 9573 provides a telemetry link 
with the Satellite Repeater. It also provides a Spectrum Analyzer Interface for 
use with the Virtual Instrument, Model 1250-A0, as well as Digital Inputs and 
Digital Outputs. Front panel USB connectors are provided for connecting this 
module to the host computer’s USB port and for connecting other modules. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion

Figure 1-19. The Virtual Instrument Package. 
The Virtual Instrument, Model 1250-A0, samples the analog signals applied to its 
two inputs in order to acquire data for the Telemetry and Instrumentation 
application. The high sampling rate (up to 1 GS/s) provides the Virtual Instrument
with a 250-MHz bandwidth that is amply sufficient for the observation and 
analysis of the various signals in the Satellite Communications Training System. 
The Virtual Instrument unit also provides an output for the analog Waveform 
Generator. 
This module requires a USB connection to the host computer. It can be 
connected to a USB connector on the Data Generation/Acquisition Interface or 
directly to a USB port on the computer. 
The Telemetry and Instrumentation application, used in conjunction with the 
Telemetry and Instrumentation Add-On, provides a user interface for telemetry 
with the Satellite Receiver. It also provides the following virtual instruments: 
 Oscilloscope 
 Spectrum Analyzer 
 Power Meter 
 BER Tester 
 Waveform Generator 
 Three user-configurable Binary Sequence Generators (BSGs) 
Refer to Appendix D Using the Telemetry and Instrumentation Add-On for 
information on connecting and operating the add-on and the software. 
a The exercises in this manual (except for procedure steps involving telemetry) 
can be performed using suitable conventional instruments and generators,

Frequency converters 
Frequency converters are used in each of the RF modules in order to shift the 
frequency of a signal up or down. A frequency converter that shifts the frequency 
up is called an up converter. A down converter shifts the frequency down. 
A frequency converter consists of a mixer and a local oscillator (LO) followed by 
a filter. The local oscillator used in a frequency converter can be either a fixedfrequency oscillator or a frequency synthesizer capable of producing a number of 
different frequencies. 
Figure 1-20.	 Frequency converter. 
In the Satellite Communications Training System, the following naming 
convention is used: 
 There are four frequency ranges in the Earth Station Transmitter and the 
Earth Station Receiver: RF, IF 2, IF 1, and the baseband. These 
frequency ranges compare as follows: 
RF		൐		IF	2			൐		IF	1		൐		baseband	frequencies
 Up Converter 2 and Down Converter 2 operate at higher frequencies 
than Up Converter 1 and Down Converter 1 
The operation of frequency 
converters is covered in

The inputs on the modules of the Satellite Communications Training System are NOT
protected against misconnection. When using the system, be sure to observe the following
precautions: 
Analog inputs (BNC connectors in analog sections) are calibrated for
voltages of 1.0 V pp. Voltages exceeding 5 V pp at analog inputs may 
damage the modules. Adjust the signal levels produced by all usersupplied equipment BEFORE connecting this equipment to the
modules. 
Digital inputs (BNC connectors in digital sections) are designed for TTL 
levels. Voltages exceeding standard TTL levels may damage the 
equipment. 
RF INPUTs (SMA connectors marked “RF INPUT”) are designed for
low level RF signals from an antenna. Never make a direct connection
between an RF OUTPUT and an RF INPUT without using an
appropriate attenuator. Excessive RF signal levels may damage the
equipment. 
IF INPUTs (SMA connectors marked “IF INPUT”) are designed for
connection to IF OUTPUTs on the system modules. 
When connecting external devices and instruments to the system modules, it is 
the user’s responsibility to make sure that all signal levels are compatible. 
Safety with RF fields 
When studying satellite communications systems, it is very important to develop 
good safety habits. Although microwaves are invisible, they can be dangerous at 
high levels or for long exposure times. The most important safety rule when 
working with microwave equipment is to avoid exposure to dangerous radiation 
levels. 
Figure 1-22 shows radiation standards established by three regulatory 
organizations: the American Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the 
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), and 
Health Canada. There are two traces for each standard, one for people classed 
as RF and microwave exposed workers (solid line) and one for people who are 
not so classed, including the general public (broken line). 
The standards are expressed in terms of plane-wave equivalent power density, 
that is, the average power per unit area normal to the direction of propagation. 
The figure also shows the maximum power density that can be produced by the 
Satellite Communications Training System using the supplied equipment. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Discussion
36 © Festo Didactic 86311-10 
Figure 1-22. Radiation safety standards. 
Figure 1-22 shows that the radiation levels in the Satellite Communications 
Training System are too low to be dangerous. The highest power level in the 
system is at the RF OUTPUT of the Earth Station Transmitter and is typically 
5 dBm (approximately 3.2 mW) at 11 GHz. The maximum possible plane-wave 
equivalent power density S using the supplied equipment would be obtained by 
connecting the Small-Aperture Horn Antenna to the RF OUTPUT of the Earth 
Station Transmitter. Neglecting losses and antenna aperture efficiency, the 
maximum power density would be approximately:

For your safety, and to develop safe work habits, avoid looking directly into the
antennas when the Earth Station Transmitter or the Satellite Repeater is on. 
The Procedure is divided into the following sections: 
 System startup
 Optimizing antenna alignment
 Analog communications
 Transmitting analog signals from external sources
 Digital communications
 Transmitting digital signals
 Data transfer
This procedure is designed to familiarize you with the basic operation of a 
satellite communications system. It will also allow you to become familiar with the 
Satellite Communications Training System and with the virtual or conventional 
instruments you will be using throughout the courseware. 
System startup 
1. If not already done, set up the system and align the antennas visually as 
shown in Appendix B. 
2. Make sure that no hardware faults have been activated in the Earth Station 
Transmitter or the Earth Station Receiver. 
b Faults in these modules are activated for troubleshooting exercises using DIP 
switches located behind a removable panel on the back of these modules. For 
normal operation, all fault DIP switches should be in the “O” position. 
3. Turn on each module that has a front panel Power switch (push the switch 
into the I position). After a few seconds, the Power LED should light. 
4. If you are using the optional Telemetry and Instrumentation Add-On: 
 Make sure there is a USB connection between the Data 
Generation/Acquisition Interface, the Virtual Instrument, and the host 
computer, as described in Appendix B. 
 Turn on the Virtual Instrument using the rear panel power switch. 
b If the TiePieSCOPE drivers need to be installed, this will be done 
automatically in Windows 7 and 8. In Windows XP, the Found New 
Hardware Wizard will appear (it may appear twice). In this case, do not 
connect to Windows Update (select No, not this time and click Next). Then 
select Install the software automatically and click Next. 
PROCEDURE OUTLINE
PROCEDUREEx. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Procedure

 Start the Telemetry and Instrumentation application. In the Application 
Selector, do not select Work in stand-alone mode. 
b If the Telemetry and Instrumentation application is already running, exit 
and restart it. This will ensure that no faults are active in the Satellite 
Repeater. 
Connection Diagrams 
Connections are shown in this manual using diagrams that contain colored 
blocks. These blocks correspond to functional blocks or sections shown on the 
front panels of the modules. Color is used to identify the module, as shown in the 
examples below: 
Other colors are used to identify the modules of the optional Telemetry and 
Instrumentation Add-On. 
The type of cable required for each connection depends on the type of 
connectors used on the modules. Microwave cables have SMA connectors 
whereas low-frequency cables have BNC connectors. 
Long microwave cables are usually used to connect the antennas, for flexibility in 
placing the antennas, although short microwave cables can be used if desired. 
Small-Aperture Horn Antennas are usually connected to the Satellite Repeater. 
Large-Aperture Horn Antennas are usually connected to the Earth Station 
Transmitter RF OUTPUT and the Earth Station Receiver RF INPUT. 
Grey blocks are instruments. These can be either conventional instruments 
provided by the user or virtual instruments included in the optional Telemetry and 
Instrumentation Add-On. 
 
In these connection diagrams, the names of the inputs and outputs of the blocks 
are given where necessary for clarity or in order to prevent ambiguity. For 
example, since the Pre-Emphasis block on the Earth Station Transmitter has only 
one input and one output, these outputs may not be named. As the Satellite 
Repeater has two outputs, however, the output to be used is always named.

Using the Telemetry and Instrumentation Add-On
To assist those who are using the optional Telemetry and Instrumentation 
Add-On, instead of conventional instruments, additional information may be 
provided showing exactly how to make the connections. For example, consider 
the circuit shown below: 
The waveform generator and the oscilloscope can be implemented using the 
Telemetry and Instrumentation Add-On, as shown in the following figure. The 
generated waveform is available at the GEN OUT connector of the Virtual 
Instrument. On the same module, the inputs CH1 IN and CH2 IN act as the 
inputs to the virtual Oscilloscope. 
In the Telemetry and Instrumentation application, the virtual Waveform Generator 
is always available and does not need to be started. It is configured using the 
Waveform Generator settings, for example: 
 Waveform Generator 
Function ......................................................... Sine 
Frequency ..................................................... 1000 kHz 
Output Level .................................................. 0.1 V 
a Because the Waveform Generator uses digital circuits, it may not be possible 
to set the Frequency to the exact frequency desired. For example, after 
entering 1000 kHz, the value changes to 999.999 kHz. 
To use the virtual Oscilloscope, click the icon, or choose Oscilloscope in the 
Instruments menu. Then set the Source setting for each channel used: 
 Oscilloscope Settings 
Channel 1 (X) 
Source ........................................................... CH1 IN 
Channel 2 (Y) 
Source ........................................................... CH2 IN 
Set the other Oscilloscope settings as required.

Optimizing antenna alignment 
This section shows an easy way to optimize alignment of the uplink and downlink 
antennas. You can use this method at any time during normal operation without 
modifying the current connections. 
5. Make the connections shown in Figure 1-23. 
b In Figure 1-23, there is no connection to the input of the modulator. This 
procedure will work, however, with or without an input signal to the modulator. 
If desired, the DQPSK Modulator can be used instead of the Wideband FM 
Modulator to provide the IF signal that is applied to Up Converter 1. 
a Although the voltmeter / power meter is not essential for aligning the antennas, 
it is suggested that you use it the first time you optimize the alignment. After 
that, you will be able to optimize the alignment by referring only to the Level 
LEDs on the modules. 
The connections shown in Figure 1-23 cause an RF signal to be transmitted 
by the Earth Station Transmitter, relayed by the Satellite Repeater, and 
received by the Earth Station Receiver. 
On the Satellite Repeater, the three Power Sensor Level LEDs provide a 
rough indication of the power at the RF OUTPUT, which is proportional to the 
power at the RF INPUT. The greater the power, the more LEDs are lit. 
On the Earth Station Receiver, the three Power Sensor Level LEDs provide a 
rough indication of the power at the IF OUTPUT of Down Converter 1, which 
is proportional to the power at the RF INPUT and to the Gain adjustment. 
During normal operation, the Gain should be adjusted so the green LED is lit. 
The red ‒ LED and  LED indicate that the power level is too low or too high, 
respectively. 
Handle microwave cables with care, especially when making or removing connections.
Make sure the connectors remain free of dust. Tighten the SMA connectors by hand until
they are snug. Do not over tighten! 
For further information on the care of microwave cables, refer to Appendix C. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Procedure

Measuring voltage and power 
A voltmeter or multimeter can be connected to any BNC connector or test point 
to measure the voltage present. In this case, the instrument is shown in 
connection diagrams as a Voltmeter. 
When connected to the POWER SENSOR OUTPUT of a module, the displayed 
voltage provides a relative indication of the power level. In this case, the 
instrument is shown in connection diagrams as a voltmeter / power meter. 
If you are using a conventional instrument, the voltage from a POWER SENSOR 
OUTPUT can be converted to an absolute power level by referring to Appendix E 
Using Conventional Instruments. 
When aligning the antennas, it is not necessary to know the absolute power 
level, a relative power level is sufficient. You can simply orient the antennas to 
maximize the dc voltage at the POWER SENSOR OUTPUT of the receiver.

Measuring power using the Telemetry and Instrumentation Add-On 
The virtual True RMS Voltmeter / Power Meter measures voltage. When 
connected to a POWER SENSOR OUTPUT, it can automatically convert the 
measured dc voltage into a power level in dBm. 
For example, in order to measure the power at Down Converter 2 of the receiver, 
the POWER SENSOR OUTPUT of the receiver must be connected to one of the 
input channels of the Virtual Instrument. The figure below shows it connected to 
CH2 IN: 
To start the True RMS Voltmeter / Power Meter, click in the toolbar of the 
Telemetry and Instrumentation application or choose Instruments  True RMS 
Voltmeter / Power Meter. 
In the True RMS Voltmeter / Power Meter, make the following settings: 
 Input 
Source ........................................................... (select the input channel used) 
Module ........................................................... (select the module) 
Mode .............................................................. Power Meter 
Click the button or select Continuous Refresh in the View menu in order to 
make a continuous measurement. Doing this again stops the measurement. 
In the Power Meter mode, the True RMS Voltmeter / Power Meter converts the 
dc voltage at any POWER SENSOR OUTPUT directly into a power reading 
in dBm. 
b Each of the three RF modules has a Power Sensor. Since each Power Sensor 
has a different power/voltage characteristic, it is important to set the Module 
setting correctly. 
You can enlarge the display of the True RMS Voltmeter / Power Meter by 
enlarging its window. This will make it more visible when aligning the antennas 
on the Satellite Repeater. 
6. Make sure the two uplink antennas are positioned and aligned so they point 
directly at each other. Do the same with the downlink antennas. 
On the Earth Station Receiver, set the Gain control to the mid position. 
Turn the antenna connected to the Earth Station Transmitter to the right or to 
the left. Note that the three Power Sensor LEDs on the Satellite Repeater
provide a relative indication of the received power level. The greater the 
power, the more LEDs are lit. If you have connected the voltmeter / power 
meter to the Earth Station Receiver, this will also provide a relative indication 
of the power. Align the two uplink antennas (on the transmitter and on the 
repeater) to maximize the power.

Turn the antenna connected to the Earth Station Receiver to the right or to 
the left. Note that the three Power Sensor LEDs on the Earth Station 
Receiver provide a relative indication of the received power level. If you have 
connected the voltmeter / power meter, this will also provide a relative 
indication of the power. Align the two downlink antennas (on repeater and on 
the receiver) to maximize the power. 
Adjust the Gain control on the Earth Station Receiver so that the green Level 
LED is lit. 
b A good way to align an antenna is to find two angular positions, on either side 
of the maximum position, where the indicated power levels are approximately 
equal, and then to point the antenna mid-way between these two positions. 
This method can be used with the Satellite Communications Training System 
and with parabolic antennas receiving signals from geostationary satellites. 
a Because of the low power levels at the Earth Station Receiver, it is quite 
sensitive to reflections for the RF signal. You may notice that the Level LEDs 
change when you move near the receiver. This is normal. 
a With the Satellite Communications Training System and normal distances, 
antenna alignment is not critical. With real satellites, however, it is essential 
that antenna alignment be optimized because of power limitations and the 
great distances involved. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Procedure

Analog communications 
7. Make the connections shown in Figure 1-24. 
Analog inputs (BNC connectors in analog sections) are calibrated for voltages of 1.0 V pp. 
Voltages exceeding 5 V pp at analog inputs may damage the modules. Adjust the signal 
levels produced by all user-supplied equipment BEFORE connecting this equipment to the
modules. 
Figure 1-24. Connections for transmitting an analog signal. 
a In order to simplify the connection diagrams used in this manual, the CH1 and 
CH2 inputs of the oscilloscope may be shown in two different blocks, as in 
Figure 1-24. 
The Satellite Repeater is not always shown explicitly in connection diagrams. It 
is always used, however, to relay the RF signal from the Earth Station 
Transmitter to the Earth Station Receiver. 
For technical reasons, the De-Emphasis block inverts the polarity of the signal. 
Although this may be apparent when observing the signals on an oscilloscope, 
it has no effect on analog transmission except for certain types of signals, such 
as video signals, where the polarity is important.

Using the Virtual Instruments
To open a virtual instrument in the Telemetry and Instrumentation application, 
choose a command in the Instruments menu or click the corresponding button on 
the toolbar. 
Three analog instruments are provided: 
 Oscilloscope 
 Spectrum Analyzer 
 True RMS Voltmeter / Power Meter 
One digital instrument is provided: 
 Bit Error Ratio Tester 
All virtual instruments have a Source setting which indicates the source of the 
signal being measured or displayed. In some cases, there is only one possible 
source. 
 For analog instruments, the Source can be CH1 IN or CH2 IN (inputs on the 
Virtual Instrument, Model 1250-A0), or Off to disable the input. 
 For the BER Tester, the Test Data Source is the Test Data Input (a digital 
input on the Data Generation/Acquisition Interface). 
Only one analog instrument can be active at the same time. The status bar 
indicates the current state of the instrument. 
Each instrument has two toolbar buttons used to select the refresh mode: 
Single Refresh and Continuous Refresh . To activate an instrument, click 
on the instrument and then click either of these buttons. Continuous Refresh
should be used to continuously monitor a signal. 
Refer to Appendix D and the on-line help for information on configuring and using 
the virtual instruments. 
8. On the Earth Station Transmitter, select a Channel in Up Converter 2. On the 
Earth Station Receiver, select the same Channel in Down Converter 2. 
a If more than one earth station is being operated in the same laboratory, each 
earth station should use a different channel. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Procedure

9. Vary the frequency and the function of the waveform generator. Observe the 
transmitted and received waveforms on the oscilloscope. Figure 1-25 shows 
an example of what you might observe. 
a The instrument screens shown in this manual were taken using the Telemetry 
and Instrumentation Add-On. If you are using conventional instruments, the 
displays will be different. In some cases, the settings used are shown in a 
condensed form in the margin. 
Figure 1-25. Transmitted and received sine wave. 
Does the received waveform resemble the transmitted waveform? 
Yes, the received waveform resembles the transmitted waveform, except that 
it is inverted by the De-emphasis block. There may also be some distortion 
that is mainly apparent when transmitting waveforms with very high 
frequency components, such as a square wave. 
Examine the front panel of the Satellite Repeater. What type of repeater is 
this? What is the main difference between this type of repeater and the other 
main type? 
The Satellite Communications Training System has a transparent repeater. 
A transparent repeater does not demodulate the uplink signal. Instead, it 
simply receives the uplink signal, shifts it to the downlink frequency, amplifies 
it, and retransmits it. A regenerative repeater, on the other hand, 
demodulates the uplink signal to recover the baseband signals, carries out 
baseband signal processing and switching, and then remodulates the 
baseband signals before transmission over the downlink. 
10. On the transmitter only, select a different Channel while observing the 
oscilloscope. This changes the frequency of the local oscillator (LO) used to 
up convert the IF 2 signal to the RF OUTPUT frequency.

What effect does this have on the frequency of the uplink signal? Does the 
receiver now receive the downlink signal? 
The frequency of the uplink signal changes. Since the Channel has not been 
changed on the receiver, the receiver does not recover the downlink signal, 
except for a small vestige that may be visible on the oscilloscope, especially 
when transmitting waveforms with very high frequency components, such as 
a square wave. 
Change the Channel on the receiver to match the new Channel selected on 
the transmitter. What effect does this have? 
This tunes the Down Converter 2 LO on the receiver to receive the downlink 
signal at the frequency corresponding to the new channel. As a result, the 
receiver now receives the downlink signal. 
Is any change on the repeater required to reestablish the link at the new 
frequencies? Explain. 
No. Because the transponder bandwidth covers the carrier frequencies of all 
channels used by the system, no adjustment on the repeater is required in 
order to use a different channel. 
Does the repeater transmit the downlink signal at the same frequency as the 
uplink signal? Explain. 
b Refer to the Discussion of this exercise. The frequencies of the RF signals will 
be measured in a later exercise. 
No, the repeater shifts the uplink signal to a lower frequency before 
retransmitting it over the downlink. This is necessary to prevent the strong 
downlink signal from interfering with the weak uplink signal. 
Transmitting analog signals from external sources 
11. Use the system to transmit an analog signal from an external source over the 
satellite link. Any analog signal in the frequency range of approximately 
10 Hz to 10 MHz can be used, providing the signal level is compatible with 
the analog inputs on the Earth Station Transmitter. 
Analog inputs (BNC connectors in analog sections) are calibrated for voltages of 1.0 V pp. 
Voltages exceeding 5 V pp at analog inputs may damage the modules. Adjust the signal 
levels produced by all user-supplied equipment BEFORE connecting this equipment to the
modules. 
a The cables and adapters included in the Accessories may be used to connect 
external devices to the Satellite Communications System. User-supplied 
adapters may also be used where necessary. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Procedure
48 © Festo Didactic 86311-10 
Except for video devices, connect the devices as follows: 
 The source device should be usually connected to the Pre-Emphasis 
INPUT, in place of the waveform generator in Figure 1-24. The signal 
from the source device will be transmitted over the satellite link to the 
receiver. 
 If a suitable device is available to monitor the received signal, it should 
be connected to the De-Emphasis OUTPUT of the receiver. The 
oscilloscope or the spectrum analyzer can also be connected to this 
output, using a BNC T-connector if necessary. 
When transmitting video signals, do not use the Pre-Emphasis/De-Emphasis 
blocks. (Using Pre-Emphasis in the transmitter will result in excessive 
deviation at the Wideband FM Modulator. Using De-Emphasis in the receiver 
inverts the demodulated signal.) Instead, connect external video devices as 
shown in Figure 1-26.

What type of connection is established over this satellite link? What type of 
connection is required for two-way communication? 
A simplex connection. A duplex connection is required for two-way 
communication. 
What type of modulation is presently being used? Explain. 
The modulation being used is wideband FM, a type of analog modulation 
frequently used in satellite communications. Analog modulation is used 
because the baseband signal is an analog signal. 
How is the output signal of the modulator transformed before transmission? 
The output signal of the WIDEBAND FM MODULATOR is shifted up in 
frequency in two stages, by Up Converter 1 AND Up Converter 2, before 
transmission. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Procedure

The QPSK Costas Loop in the Digital Demodulator 
This section shows what happens as the Costas loop on the Earth Station 
Receiver locks and also shows how to lock it manually. 
Locking the QPSK Costas loop
All forms of PSK modulation, including QPSK and DQPSK, are suppressedcarrier types of modulation. For demodulation to occur, the QPSK Costas loop in 
the Earth Station Receiver must be locked onto the received QPSK signal in 
order to recover the suppressed carrier. Once the loop is locked, a feedback 
circuit keeps it locked, causing it to track the signal in order to maintain the 
recovered carrier at the correct frequency and phase. 
The QPSK Costas loop contains a VCO whose frequency and phase are 
controlled by the voltage at the output of an integrator. This voltage can be 
measured at TP1 on the Earth Station Receiver. The Center Frequency control 
on the receiver sets one of the integrator input voltages. This control is used in 
locking the loop. 
There is no indicator on the Earth Station Receiver to directly indicate whether 
the Costas loop is locked or not. There are, however, three indirect indications 
that the Costas loop is locked: 
 The Frame Recovery section of the TDM DEMUX in the receiver includes a 
Sync. LED. This LED lights when the framing bits generated by the 
Clock & Frame Encoder on the transmitter have been recognized. Since this 
can only occur when the Costas loop is locked, the Sync. LED can serve as 
an indicator of the locked condition, providing the Clock & Frame Encoder on 
the transmitter is turned on. 
 Digital data from the transmitter is correctly demodulated by the receiver only 
when the Costas loop is locked. This is true whether the Clock & Frame 
Encoder and Decoder are on or off. 
 When the Costas loop is locked, the voltage at TP1 of the receiver remains 
fixed at a certain level, except for slight fluctuations. You can determine the 
locked-condition voltage by measuring the voltage at TP1 when the Costas 
loop is known to be locked. 
The QPSK Costas loop is designed to be locked manually, although under 
certain conditions, it may lock without manual intervention. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Procedure
© Festo Didactic 86311-10 51
12. Make the connections shown in Figure 1-27. 
Figure 1-27.	 Minimal connections for locking the QPSK Costas Loop. 
a Figure 1-27 shows the minimal connections required for this step. The QPSK 
Costas Loop can also be locked while other connections are made to the 
Digital Modulator and the Digital Demodulator. 
The QPSK Costas loop is designed to work with a modulated signal that 
contains all possible phases, such as one carrying relatively complex data. 
When no data source is connected to the transmitter, turning on the Scrambler 
will ensure that all phases are present in the modulated signal. 
13. On the Earth Station Transmitter, make the following adjustments:

14. After making these adjustments, the Sync. LED may go on after a few 
seconds, indicating that the Costas loop is locked. 
If the Sync. LED does not go on: 
 Turn the Center Frequency knob of the QPSK Costas Loop to either 
extreme position (see Position 1 in Figure 1-28, for example). 
 After a few seconds, turn the knob to the other extreme position (see 
Position 2). Wait until the Sync. LED in the Frame Recovery section of 
the TDM DEMUX lights. When it lights, the Costas Loop is locked. 
 Turn the knob to the mid position (Position 3). 
a When the Costas loop is locked, the Center Frequency knob has no effect. 
However, it is preferable to leave it in the mid position.

If the Sync. LED is off, the TP1 
voltage is falling.

voltage is rising.

b The  and  LEDs in the QPSK Costas Loop provide a rough indication of the 
voltage at TP1. When the  LED is lit, the voltage is too low to allow the loop to 
lock; when the  LED is lit, the voltage is too high. Ex. 1-1 – Satellite Communication Systems  Procedure
© Festo Didactic 86311-10 53
15. The Costas loop is easy to lock using the method shown in Step 14. 
However, it is useful to examine the signals before and after the loop reaches 
the locked condition. 
Figure 1-29.	 Connections for the Costas loop (Satellite Repeater used but not shown). 
The following steps will allow you to observe the signals: 
1. Make the connections shown in Figure 1-29. In this figure, DATA 
INPUT 1 on the transmitter and DATA OUTPUT 1 on the receiver are 
used. However, any other corresponding input-output pair can be used. 
A probe is used to connect test point TP1 of the Earth Station Receiver
to the oscilloscope. Set the switch on the probe to the x1 position. 
b You can use a conventional dc voltmeter, rather than the oscilloscope, to 
monitor the voltage at TP1. 
When connecting a probe to a test point, be sure to connect the ground 
clip to a ground loop on the module front panel. 
Configure the binary sequence generator (BSG) to produce a pseudorandom sequence. Set n and the Bit Rate as desired (for example, set 
n to 4 and the Bit Rate to 100 000 bit/s). 
Set the time base of the oscilloscope to display roughly one or two bits 
per division (for a bit rate of 100 000 bit/s, you could use a time base of 
20 s/div). Trigger the oscilloscope on the EXT TRIG signal. 
A pseudo-random sequence 
is not truly random but repeats after L bits. The sequence length L = 2n-1 
where n is the number of 
shift registers used to generate the sequence.

Center Frequency .......................................... mid position

Because a pseudo-random binary sequence is being transmitted, the 
Scrambler and Descrambler can both be either On or Off. 
3. Observe the DATA OUTPUT 1 signal on the oscilloscope. If the Costas 
loop is locked, you will see the recovered data. Otherwise, an apparently 
random signal will be displayed, as shown in Figure 1-30. 
Figure 1-30. TP1 voltage and DATA OUTPUT 1 (Costas loop unlocked). 
4. Change the CHANNEL on the receiver (select a channel that is not being 
used by another transmitter in the same laboratory). On the receiver, the 
POWER SENSOR ““ LED lights to show that there is no received signal 
and the Sync. LED will be off. The oscilloscope will display an apparently 
random signal. 
5. Observe dc voltage at TP1 on the oscilloscope. On the Earth Station 
Receiver, turn the Center Frequency knob fully clockwise and wait. The 
Center Frequency knob sets the voltage at one input of an integrator in 
the feedback loop. The dc voltage at TP1 is the output voltage of the 
integrator. This dc voltage will gradually rise to its maximum value. 
The ““ LED in the QPSK Costas Loop will light when the dc voltage is 
above the range where locking is possible. 
6. On the Earth Station Receiver, slowly turn the Center Frequency knob 
counterclockwise. When the knob is below the center position, the

56 © Festo Didactic 86311-10 
dc voltage shown on the oscilloscope will begin to fall. Turning the knob 
further beyond the center position makes the voltage fall more rapidly. 
Eventually, the dc voltage will reach its minimum value. The “” LED in 
the QPSK Costas Loop will light when the dc voltage is below the range 
where locking is possible. 
b If the dc voltage was allowed to rise too high, it may be difficult to reduce it 
using the Frequency Control. In this case, temporarily reduce the Gain on 
Down Converter 1. 
7. On the Earth Station Receiver and the Earth Station Transmitter select 
the same Channel. The green POWER SENSOR Level LED on the 
Earth Station Receiver should be lit. 
8. Turn the Center Frequency knob to the maximum position (see 
Position 2 in Figure 1-28). The dc voltage will begin to rise. Eventually, 
the Costas loop will lock and the Sync. LED will light. At this moment, the 
demodulated digital data will be displayed on the oscilloscope, as shown 
in Figure 1-31. 
Figure 1-31. Costas loop locked. 
Note the dc voltage at TP1; this is the locked-condition voltage. 
Locked-condition voltage: ___________ V 
a The locked-condition voltage is not necessarily the same on each Earth 
Station Receiver. 
Locked-condition voltage: approximately 1.8 V 
9. Turn the Center Frequency knob to either extreme position. Note that the 
dc voltage at TP1 does not change. When the Costas loop is locked, the 
feedback loop keeps this voltage at a virtually constant level and the 
Center Frequency control has no effect. 
b If this voltage at TP1 of the receiver is stable at the locked-condition 
voltage, you can assume that the Costas loop is locked. 
When viewing a sequence 
of bits on the oscilloscope in 
the normal display format, a 
low level corresponds to 0 
and a high level corresponds to 1.

original binary sequence. 
Vary the binary sequence and the bit rate. 
b The maximum bit rate at Data Inputs 1 to 4 on the Earth Station Transmitter is 
4 Mbit/s. The maximum bit rate at Data Input 5 is 20 Mbit/s. (This is also the 
maximum Bit Rate for each BSG of the Telemetry and Instrumentation 
Add-On.) 
You may need to adjust the Trigger Level a little as you vary the n value. It

Is the sequence always recovered correctly at the receiver? 
Yes, the two sequences are identical except for a slight delay in the received 
sequence.

19. DATA INPUT 4 on the Earth Station Transmitter has a USB connector. DATA 
OUTPUT 4 on the Earth Station Receiver also has a USB connector. 
Connect these two USB connectors to one or two computers. There are a 
number of ways to make these connections, as shown in the examples 
below. 
a The use of two computers allows sending data from one computer (connected 
to the Earth Station Transmitter) over the satellite link to the other computer 
(connected to the Earth Station Receiver). 
When using only one computer, this computer is connected to both the Earth 
Station Transmitter and the Earth Station Receiver. In this case, the data from 
the computer is sent over the satellite link and received by the same computer. 
Note that only one computer can be connected to the Telemetry and 
Instrumentation Add-On.

Using two computers: 
20. Start the two Data Transfer applications: Data Transmitter and Data 
Receiver. 
a If you are using two computers, start the Data Transmitter application on the 
computer connected to the Earth Station Transmitter and the Data Receiver 
application on the computer connected to the Earth Station Receiver. 
Make sure the green USB indicator in each of these applications is lit. This 
indicates that a connection has been established with the computer. 
21. Select the Message tab in both the Data Transmitter and the Data Receiver. 
In the Data Transmitter, type or paste a text message and click Send. The 
text message should appear in the Data Receiver.

22. Select the Real-Time Data tab in both the Data Transmitter and the Data 
Receiver. This tab simulates a remote weather station that continually sends 
meteorological data via a satellite link. 
In the Data Transmitter, click the Start button. The current data is transmitted 
every second. Change any value and observe the received data in the Data 
Receiver. 
Click the Random Data button to generate data that varies randomly every 
second. Note that the data is sent from the transmitter to the receiver every 
second. 
23. Select the Files tab in both the Data Transmitter and the Data receiver. This 
tab allows sending files. 
In the Data Transmitter, click the Browse button. Open a folder and select 
one or more files. The selected files will appear in the list (the previous list 
will be cleared). 
a The transfer rate via the USB port is approximately 2 Mbit/s. Transferring large 
files can take a considerable amount of time. 
Since no error correction is provided by the data transfer applications, it is 
preferable to avoid transferring large files. 
The Destination Folder in the Data Receiver shows where the received files 
will be placed. If you wish to change this folder, use the Browse button. 
In the Data Transmitter, click Send All. 
24. When you have finished using the system, exit any software being used and 
turn off the equipment. 
In this exercise, you became familiar with the Satellite Communications Training 
System and learned how to optimize the antenna alignment. You observed the 
entire system in operation by transmitting and receiving analog and digital 
signals. You also observed data transfer over the satellite link. 
1. Name and briefly describe the two main subsystems of a communications 
satellite. 
The two main subsystems are the payload and the platform. The payload 
consists of all the components that provide communications services, that is, 
which receive, process, amplify and retransmit information. The platform 
consists of all the components that maintain the satellite in the desired orbit 
and attitude and that permit the payload to operate and to remain operational 
over a long period of time.

2. Briefly describe the three segments of a satellite communications system. 
The space segment (SS) consists of all the satellite in space including 
backup satellites. It also includes the launch vehicles and all the facilities 
needed to place the satellites in the desired orbits. The ground segment (GS) 
consists of the traffic Earth stations and all ground-based facilities used for 
communications traffic. The control segment (CS) consists of all groundbased facilities required for the operation, control, monitoring, and 
management of the space segment. 
3. Compare SCPC and MCPC and give some advantages and disadvantages 
of each. 
With SCPC (single channel per carrier), each carrier carries only one signal, 
that is, there is no multiplexing involved. With MCPC (multiple channels per 
carrier), a number of signals are multiplexed in the baseband before 
modulation in the transmitter and demultiplexed after demodulation in the 
receiver. 
SCPC is the simpler technique and allows flexible use of the available 
bandwidth without reconfiguration of the transponder. It makes it easy uplink 
from multiple earth stations to the same transponder and to add receiving 
earth stations. However, it uses the available bandwidth less efficiency than 
MCPC. MCPC is more efficient, does not require a dedicated channel for 
each connection, and is ideal for burst transmissions. However, it requires 
that all signals are multiplexed at one location and demultiplexed at another 
location. 
4. The information carried over a satellite link is carried over different signals 
that occupy different frequency ranges. Briefly describe these signals and the 
purpose they serve. 
The baseband signal contains the information that one wants to transmit from 
one user terminal to another. It occupies frequencies between 0 Hz and the 
highest frequency in the signal. The baseband signal modulates a carrier at 
an intermediate frequency to produce an IF signal that occupies a frequency 
band considerably higher than the baseband. The IF signal is up converted in 
one or more stages to the RF frequency used to transmit the signal to the 
satellite. This RF signal occupies highest frequency band in the satellite 
communications system. 
5. What are some of the main factors that influence the choice of RF frequency 
band used for different types of satellite links? 
The lower the frequency band, the better the propagation characteristics, but, 
the higher the frequency band, the greater the available bandwidth. With 
these higher frequency bands, antennas are more directional which allows 
using spatial separation to avoid interference between links using the same 
frequency. © Festo Didactic 86311-10 381
